### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Pavel from Ukraine, and I am a full stack developer with 7+ years of experience as a Software Developer specializing in UI development, Content Management Systems(CMS), and in the areas including Internet/Intranet technology, client/server, and multitier applications.

- ðŸ’¬ 
I began my journey as a Software Engineer at University in 2015. I have years of experience working in PHP frameworks including Laravel (w/Vue.js,) Symfony, CodeIgniter, and CakePHP.

My philosophy is designing and programming web applications that link business goals with customer service, while also creating engagement with entertainment - skills are transferred through my past career in fine dining. I truly enjoy working with people. I bring extensive experience using multiple standard programming languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Python, React, Redux, React Native, Typescript, Node.js, Express, ASP.NET, C#, Laravel, Firebase, GraphQL, MySQL. I am detail-oriented with a strong understanding of aesthetic and design principles, with excellent troubleshooting and bug resolution skills.

I work with my clients, efficiently, clearly defining their needs and itâ€™s a primary goal of mine to manage expectations. I do not up-sell my clients on frivolous things, I do not take on work that I do not fully understand and I make it a priority to make sure that anyone I work with will know what they are going to get.

Looking for a long-term, full-time project! Feel free to contact me if you need my help!
